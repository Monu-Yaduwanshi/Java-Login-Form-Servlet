# Java-Login-Form-Servlet
This project is a simple login application implemented using Java Servlets, MySQL database, and Apache Tomcat server. It provides a basic framework for user authentication, allowing users to log in with their credentials.

# Java-Login-Form-Servlet 🚪🔐

Welcome to the **Java-Login-Form-Servlet** project! This simple web application showcases how to implement user authentication using Java Servlets, a MySQL database, and the Apache Tomcat server. It serves as a foundational framework for validating user credentials, perfect for beginners looking to understand the basics of Java web development with database integration.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔑 User Authentication**: Users can securely log in with their username and password, which are validated against stored credentials in a MySQL database.
- **🗄️ Database Connection**: The application connects to a MySQL database using JDBC to verify user details.
- **⚠️ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for database connection issues and JDBC driver errors, ensuring smooth user experience.
- **🎨 Responsive Design**: The login form is crafted with a clean, user-friendly layout using HTML and CSS, delivering a seamless experience across devices.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Java Servlet API**: The backbone of the application, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores user credentials and allows for database-driven authentication.
- **Apache Tomcat Server**: Manages the deployment of the servlet and handles web server operations.
- **HTML/CSS**: Provides a simple yet elegant frontend for users to interact with.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

 Configure the MySQL Database:
Create a MySQL database named logindata.
Create a table named users with the following structure:
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

Populate the table with sample user data for testing:
INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('testuser', 'password123');

Deploy on Apache Tomcat:
Open Eclipse IDE and import the project by navigating to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace.
Set up Apache Tomcat within Eclipse by adding a new server configuration.
Run the project on Tomcat through Run As > Run on Server.
4. Access the Application:
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8080/your-context-path/LoginPage.html

Here, you’ll be presented with a login form. Enter the credentials you’ve stored in the MySQL database and authenticate your session!

📝 Notes
Future Enhancements: While the application currently only supports simple user authentication, you can extend its functionality by adding features such as password encryption, user session management, and role-based access control.
JDBC Connectivity: Ensure that you have the MySQL JDBC Driver configured in your project to establish a successful connection between Java Servlets and MySQL.
